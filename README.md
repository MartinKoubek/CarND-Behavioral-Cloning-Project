# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-Project-
This repository contains files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

My solution to the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Behavioral Cloning project.

There is python scripts: model.py that:
* load images
* flip some of images in order to get more input data
* calculate neural network


# Project Specification #

Use Deep Learning to Clone Driving Behavior

The main purpose of this script is to train the model using the data saved from the above python script.
First, it imports the pickle file from the local drive and train the data using model that I built.
The detail of the model can be found in the script.
When the training is done, the model is saved as model.h5.

# Training #
Below is the summary of the model I implemented to train the data.
