# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-Project-
This repository contains files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

My solution to the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Behavioral Cloning project.

There is python scripts: model.py that:
* load images
* flip some of images in order to get more input data
* calculate neural network
